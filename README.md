# `equaliser-android`

This is a mobile app that interacts with the same API as the website.

## Launch

In theory, you should be able to get away with installing the latest Android SDK and running `./gradlew build` to compile the project.

To actually run it, I would strongly recommend using Android Studio, which has a built-in emulator.
